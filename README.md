## My Process

This project was built to practice my **React** skills, focusing on **state management** and **logic implementation**. I wanted to create a fun and interactive game that could also serve as a great learning experience for understanding how to handle dynamic data, manage state, and implement game logic in React.

### Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped styling and modular design.
- **useState and useEffect**: React hooks used for managing game state, card flips, and timer.
- **JavaScript**: Modern JavaScript (ES6+) for game functionality and logic.
